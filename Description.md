# google_voice_search
This is a project in which I have used python libraries to search google using voice commands and display the search results accordingly.
It uses python libraries like SpeechRecognition,pyttsx3 and googlesearch
Make sure to install the above mentioned libraries using 'pip' command before executing the code.

Thank you!!!
